We distinguish between the following types of values:

Immediate values, such as `42` and `hello` in the following examples
```
Output.write(42, "hello")
```

Resolveable values, such as `result` and `name` in the following example (assuming `number result = 1 + 3` and `name = "yotam"`)
```
Output.write(result, name)
```

Obtainable values - the result of method calls i.e.
```
self.add(2, 2)
```
